Curry
=====

Traditionally partial evaluation of functions is handled with the ``partial``
higher order function from ``functools``.  Currying provides syntactic sugar.

.. code::

    >>> double = partial(mul, 2)    # Partial evaluation
    >>> twice = double(2)           # Currying

This syntactic sugar is valuable when developers chain several higher order
functions together.

Partial Evaluation
------------------

Often when composing smaller functions to form big ones we need partial
evaluation.  We do this in the word counting example:

.. code::

    >>> def stem(word):
    ...     """ Stem word to primitive form """
    ...     return word.lower().rstrip(",.!:;'-\"").lstrip("'\"")

    >>> wordcount = compose(frequencies, partial(map, stem), str.split)

Here we want to map the ``stem`` function onto each of the words produced by
``str.split``.  We want a ``stem_many`` function that takes a list of words,
stems them, and returns a list back.  In full form this would look like the
following:

.. code::

    >>> def stem_many(words):
    ...     return map(stem, words)

The ``partial`` function lets us create this function more naturally.

.. code::

    >>> stem_many = partial(map, stem)

In general

.. code::

    >>> def f(x, y, z):
    ...     # Do stuff with x, y, and z

    >>> # partially evaluate f with known values a and b
    >>> def g(z):
    ...     return f(a, b, z)

    >>> # partially evaluate f with known values a and b
    >>> g = partial(f, a, b)

Curry
-----

In this context currying is just syntactic sugar for partial evaluation.  A
curried function partially evaluates if it does not receive enough arguments to
compute a result.

.. code::

    >>> from toolz import curry

    >>> @curry              # We can use curry as a decorator
    ... def mul(x, y):
    ...     return x * y

    >>> double = mul(2)     # mul didn't receive enough arguments to evaluate
    ...                     # so it holds onto the 2 and waits, returning a
    ...                     # partially evaluated function, double

    >>> double(5)
    10

So if ``map`` was curried...

.. code::

    >>> map = curry(map)

Then we could replace the ``partial`` with a function evaluation

.. code::

    >>> # wordcount = compose(frequencies, partial(map, stem), str.split)
    >>> wordcount = compose(frequencies, map(stem), str.split)

In this particular example it's probably simpler to stick with ``partial``.
Once ``partial`` starts occurring several times in your code it may be time to
switch to the ``curried`` namespace.

The Curried Namespace
---------------------

All functions present in the ``toolz`` namespace are curried in the
``toolz.curried`` namespace.

So you can exchange an import line like the following

.. code::

    >>> from toolz import *

For the following

.. code::

    >>> from toolz.curried import *

And all of your favorite ``toolz`` functions will curry automatically.  We've
also included curried versions of the standard Python higher order functions
like ``map``, ``filter``, ``reduce`` so you'll get them too (whether you like
it or not.)
