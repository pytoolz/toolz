Installation and Dependencies
=============================

Toolz is pure Python and so is easily installable by the standard
dependency manageers ``pip`` and ``easy_install``::

    easy_install toolz

or::
    
    pip install toolz

Toolz endeavors to be a very light dependency.  It accomplishes this in two ways:

1.  Toolz is pure Python and relies only on the standard library
2.  Toolz simultaneously supports Python versions 2.6, 2.7, 3.2, 3.3
