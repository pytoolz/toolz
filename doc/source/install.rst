Installation and Dependencies
=============================

Toolz is pure Python and so is easily installable by the standard
dependency manager ``pip``::

    pip install toolz

Toolz endeavors to be a very light dependency.  It accomplishes this in
three ways:

1.  Toolz is pure Python
2.  Toolz relies only on the standard library
3.  Toolz simultaneously supports Python versions 3.8+ and PyPy
