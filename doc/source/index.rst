Toolz API Documentation
=======================

The Toolz project provides a set of utility functions for iterators, functions,
and dictionaries.  These functions are designed to interoperate well, forming
the building blocks of common data analytic operations.  They extend the
standard libraries `itertools` and `functools`.
