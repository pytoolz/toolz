Toolz API Documentation
=======================

The Toolz project provides a set of utility functions for iterators, functions,
and dictionaries.  These functions are designed to interoperate well, forming
the building blocks of common data analytic operations.

Toolz provides a suite of functions which have the following virtues:

-   **Composable**: They interoperate due to their use of core data structures
-   **Pure**:  They don't change their inputs or rely on external state
-   **Lazy**:  They don't run until absolutely necessary, allowing them to
           support large streaming data sets

This gives developers the power to write *powerful* programs to solve *complex
problems* with relatively *simple code* which is *easy to understand* without
sacrificing *performance*.  Toolz enables this approach, commonly associated
with functional programming, within a natural Pythonic style suitable for
most developers.
